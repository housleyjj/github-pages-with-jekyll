# Hello World
### My first blog post

Hello everyone.  I am starting to learn all about github.  This is a fun adventure as I always like learning and this is so far
sticking as a hobby.  I have always enjoyed programming, but I haven't been able to much in the past.  However, now I've
been setting aside several hours a day to learn all about github, Python, and Azure.
